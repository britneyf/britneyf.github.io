The concept of giftedness began to take shape in the 1910s and, by the 1920s, became closely tied to a narrower understanding of intelligence and challenges in urban public education. This early focus on giftedness arose, in part, alongside the broader eugenics movement, which regarded certain cognitive capacities as both innate and racially inflected, and saw their cultivation—or neglect—as carrying grave consequences for the nation's future heredity. Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman's study of intellectually gifted children, for example, was grounded in the assumptions of the era, including eugenic ideas about intelligence as a heritable, fixed trait. Terman explicitly connected high intelligence with desirable heredity and saw his work as contributing to the \"improvement\" of the population. Over time, however, this emphasis on inherent talent gradually shifted toward the belief that giftedness could be developed and nurtured through proper educational and domestic environments, rather than remaining a fixed, inherited trait. The mathematician Robert J. Aley wrote in ",(0,o.jsx)("i",{children:"The Journal of Education"}),' at this time: "It is a fact that every child born into the world has the right to be understood and to realize his greatest possibility. This truth applies to the gifted child as well as the child lowest in the scale. It is high time that our schools were giving to these extraordinary children the attention that their work merits." Scholarly discussions about giftedness extended beyond academic circles, gaining traction in the media and in parenting guidebooks. Media coverage highlighted the issue of gifted students being overlooked in schools, while guidebooks provided parents with practical advice on nurturing and supporting their talented children. By the 1960s, giftedness had seeped far into the school and the home for many families, with specialized curricula, individualized enrichment programs, and a host of extracurricular activities all geared toward honing a child\'s perceived exceptional abilities, all profoundly shaping the expectations on many children.']}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{children:"As the phenomenon developed over the decades, it maintained a strong tie to American values and ideals.

This pursuit of excellence shaped not just individual parenting practices, but broader educational and cultural policies, transforming childhood into a proving ground for potential greatness. Programs for identifying and nurturing gifted students proliferated, while schools adopted testing systems to single out and develop the next generation of leaders and thinkers. The idea of raising gifted children became not just a personal ambition for families, but a patriotic duty. We broadcast stories of greatness and we scan for it in our children.

By these outcomes, the word "gifted" starts to feel hollow—it becomes more of a burden of pressure and expectation than a ticket toward success.

Laura introduces TKS by writing, "I was that worked-up kid with big dreams and no direction, and TKS was the first place that gave me an outlet for my drive. It was what I needed at the time—reasons to work hard, mentors to encourage my ambition, and social systems to support my self-driven projects, unrestricted by my age. TKS was the first time I was so effectively convinced that each and every day of my life was meaningful, to the point of supposed self-actualization." It\'s easy for impressionable children to be convinced that they need a type of gifted program to push them forward or help them realize their potential, that they wouldn\'t be able to achieve on their own. Especially for children who are already naturally ambitious, having institutional validation of your exceptionality is an affirming reason to believe you can achieve the American ideal of greatness. We\'re taught to write cold emails to find grander and grander opportunities, to submit to international competitions for recognition, to use our age as a metric of impressiveness.

I treated every aspect of my life as a lever to be optimized. I became elitist and judgmental, shunning anyone who was not deemed \'interesting\' and \'unconventional.\' TKS was the first time I was so effectively convinced to live each and every day in part by someone else\'s idea of meaningfulness, to the point of destructive self-deception." If "meaninglessness" and "destructive self-deception" are the endpoints that these children are driven to in gifted programs, surely we should rethink not only how these programs are designed, but whether we should be shoving young minds into them in the first place.

To start, they didn\'t always excel in school; in fact, a good fraction of exceptional people (⅔ of Karlsson\'s sample) were home-schooled. Instead, they "had time to roam about and relied heavily on self-directed learning" —exploring niche interests until they found something to be obsessive about, and got incredibly good at it. The renowned scientist Carl Sagan, in his book on the evolution of human intelligence, said that the "development of such gifted individuals required a childhood period in which there was little or no pressure for conformity, a time in which the child could develop and pursue his or her own interests no matter how unusual or bizarre" . The problem with the students in gifted programs is that they are taught to conform—you are validated if you get good test scores, if you excel in classes.

Time and time again, external pressure ends up depriving children of happiness when they're young, when being young is one of the most important times to be happy. Furthermore, not only could gifted programs (and the ideals behind them) hurt kids, they may do the opposite of what's intended and make kids less ambitious and less motivated by approaching developing exceptional people the wrong way: they use test scores and other external metrics to drive kids to some sort of exemplary goal, often being at the top of the class or getting into higher level classes or performing well at tests. As a result, they get little time to figure things out on their own and peruse subjects in a stress-free environment before finding something they're truly passionate about.

In other words, internal pressure as opposed to external pressure. At the end of his essay, Karlsson proposes that the solution to this is simple: "It is just a way of viewing children: as capable of competence, as craving meaningful work, as worthy to be included in serious discussions. We can learn to view them like that, but it is a subtle and profound shift in perception, a shift away from the way we are taught to view children. American will continue to chase exceptionalism, and children will continue to be the source we look towards for the next generational of it. But as simple as it is to simply outsource the development of our children to general programs created for the sake of scalability and ideology, we should think about cultivating talent as a careful, purposeful act of listening and guidance—one that honors each child\'s capacity to wonder, to create, and to redefine success on their own terms.'})]})}),(0,o.jsx)("a",{className:"horizontal center-v pb-20 cursor-pointer",onClick:()=>window.scrollTo({top:0,behavior:"smooth"}),children:"[↑ back to top]"})]})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[648,971,23,744],function(){return e(e.s=5761)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
